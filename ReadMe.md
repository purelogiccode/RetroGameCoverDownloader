## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or later

1. Grab the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/purelogiccode/RetroGameCoverDownloader/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location
3. Run `RetroGameCoverDownloader.exe`

## 🔧 Configuration

### GitHub Token (Recommended)
To unlock the full 4,900 downloads/hour limit:

1. Go to **File → GitHub Token** in the menu bar (the token dialog also appears automatically on first launch)
2. Follow the in-app instructions or:
    - Visit [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
    - Generate a token with **`public_repo`** scope
    - Copy and paste it into the application

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Main window uses ViewModels; dialogs use code-behind for simplicity
- **Async/Await**: Fully asynchronous operations for UI responsiveness
- **WPF-UI**: Modern Fluent Design dark theme with dynamic resources
- **Serilog**: Structured logging with buffered UI sink, file sink, and debug output
- **Rate Limiting**: Custom `RateLimiter` service with event notifications
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and bug reporting via BugReportSink
- **Circuit Breaker**: Tracks consecutive 503 errors and triggers cooldown to avoid hammering distressed servers
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable retry attempts

### Key Components
- `MainViewModel`: Core business logic and state management
- `GitHubService`: Handles all GitHub API interactions
- `BugReportService` / `BugReportSink`: Automatic error reporting via structured Serilog sink
- `SettingsManager`: JSON-based settings persistence with DPAPI encryption for sensitive data
- `RateLimiter`: Intelligent API request throttling
- `UpdateCheckerService`: Checks for new application versions

### Testing
The project includes a comprehensive test suite using **xunit**:

```bash
dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration"
```

Tests cover models, services, helpers, converters, commands, ViewModels, managers, and integration tests. A `MockBugReportService` is injected via `[ModuleInitializer]` to prevent real API calls during testing.

The integration tests call the live GitHub API and are excluded above. They need a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to stay within GitHub's rate limits and are skipped without one; to run them:

```bash
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_your_token"
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"
```
